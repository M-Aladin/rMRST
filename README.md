rMRST
=====

The goal of rMRST is to provide an interface to operate MRST (Matlab Rservoir Simulation Toolbox) from R to analyze and plot results using R embedded statistical tools.

Right now rMRST is running in Unix under the flavor Linux Mint 18.2. R version being used for devlopment is 3.4.1 and Octave 4.0.

Special Thanks
--------------

to Jim Bennet and Miguel Quispe for opening my curiosity and apetite on the reservoir simulation in Octave and solving Partial Differential Equations for simulation.

Installation
------------

You can install rMRST from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("f0nzie/rMRST")
```

Example
-------

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
## basic example code
```
